Did both  Slaughter-House Cases and United States v. Darby Lumber Co. involve civil rights law?,no,"Thought: To answer this question, I need to understand the context and legal focus of both cases.

Step 1: Research the Slaughter-House Cases.
The Slaughter-House Cases (1873) were a series of United States Supreme Court cases that dealt with the Fourteenth Amendment and its application to the states. The main issue was whether the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause protected the right of individuals to conduct business in their chosen manner.

Step 2: Research the United States v. Darby Lumber Co.
United States v. Darby Lumber Co. (1941) was a United States Supreme Court case that upheld the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which established minimum wage and maximum hours for workers. The case focused on the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce and the application of the Commerce Clause.

Step 3: Compare the legal focus of both cases.
The Slaughter-House Cases primarily dealt with the Fourteenth Amendment and its application to the states, while",,"No, the Slaughter-House Cases primarily dealt with the interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment in terms of citizenship rights, which is related to civil rights but not specifically focused on civil rights law. United States v. Darby Lumber Co., on the other hand, upheld the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which is directly related to labor rights and employment conditions, a subset of civil rights law. Therefore, while both cases touch on aspects of civil rights, United States v. Darby Lumber Co. is more directly involved in civil rights law.","No, the Slaughter-House Cases primarily dealt with the interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment and the concept of privileges and immunities, which is not directly related to civil rights law as it pertains to discrimination and equal protection. United States v. Darby Lumber Co., on the other hand, involved the Fair Labor Standards Act, which is related to labor rights and economic regulations rather than civil rights law. Civil rights law typically addresses issues of discrimination and equal treatment under the law, particularly in the context of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.","Slaughter-House Cases involved civil rights law; United States v. Darby Lumber Co. involved labor law, not directly civil rights.",,,,
